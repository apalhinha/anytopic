# Create a Google Analytics ID

A new site or App require a new Analytics ID

1. Login to google analytics
1. Select the account. Accounts are a top level grouping per project, presumably with a given set of permissions for a
given group of users. A given project with 2 web sites and one app would need (3 trackers) should fit in a single account
1. Create the property
1. Associate the property to the Search Console
   1. Not sure on the advantage, just followed google's recommendation
   
Because this property was for a GitHub Pages site, I've added
```google_analytics: UA-XXXXXXXXX-X
to _config.yml
